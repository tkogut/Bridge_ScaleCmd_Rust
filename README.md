## 🚀 Quick Start (Windows Development)

### Prerequisites Setup
The project now uses **MinGW/MSYS2** toolchain for Windows builds (GNU instead of MSVC):

```powershell
# 1. Ensure MSYS2 MinGW-64 is installed at: D:\msys64\mingw64
# 2. Run the setup script
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Setup-MinGW.ps1"
```

### Build & Run Backend
```powershell
# Method 1: Direct execution in PowerShell (recommended)
.\build-rust-mingw.ps1              # Debug build (faster compilation)
.\build-rust-mingw.ps1 --release    # Release build (optimized)

# Method 2: Using powershell.exe (from CMD or anywhere)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "build-rust-mingw.ps1"
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "build-rust-mingw.ps1" --release

# Run the server (from project root directory)
.\run-backend.ps1
# Or: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-backend.ps1"

# Alternative: Run directly with cargo (from src-rust directory)
cd src-rust
cargo run                    # Debug build
cargo run --release          # Release build (optimized)

# Or run the compiled executable directly (from src-rust directory)
.\target\release\scaleit-bridge.exe    # Release version
.\target\debug\scaleit-bridge.exe      # Debug version

# Server available at: http://localhost:8080
```

**Important:** In PowerShell, always use `.\` prefix before script name:
- ✅ Correct: `.\build-rust-mingw.ps1 --release`
- ❌ Wrong: `build-rust-mingw.ps1 --release`

**Build Script Features:**
- ✅ Automatic MinGW toolchain configuration
- ✅ Cleans previous builds for fresh start
- ✅ Runs full test suite after build
- ✅ Stops interfering processes (AVG Firewall, etc.)
- ✅ Detailed error messages and troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Supports both debug and release builds

### Quick Start Scripts (Windows Batch Files)

For convenience, use these batch files to start development:

```batch
# Start both backend and frontend servers
start-dev.bat

# Run all tests with MinGW environment
run-tests.bat
```

**Note:** These batch files automatically configure MinGW environment and start servers in separate windows.

### Run Frontend
```bash
# In a separate terminal
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend available at: http://localhost:5173
```

### Run Tests
```powershell
# Method 1: Using batch file (easiest)
.\run-tests.bat

# Method 2: Using PowerShell script directly
.\test-rust-mingw.ps1
# Or: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "test-rust-mingw.ps1"

# Method 3: Manual setup (requires MinGW environment)
# First setup MinGW environment:
.\Setup-MinGW.ps1
# Then run tests:
cd src-rust
cargo test
```

**Important:** Tests require MinGW environment to be configured. The `test-rust-mingw.ps1` script and `run-tests.bat` automatically configure the MinGW environment for you. If running tests manually with `cargo test`, first run `Setup-MinGW.ps1` to configure the environment.

### Package Installer
```powershell
# Build backend, frontend and create installer in one shot
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/prepare-installer.ps1" -Version "1.0.0" -OutputPath ".\release"
```
This helper script:
1. Rebuilds the Rust backend with the MinGW toolchain (`build-rust-mingw.ps1`)
2. Compiles the React frontend (`npm run build`)
3. Executes `Create-InstallerPackage.ps1` to bundle the binaries, frontend assets, scripts and docs into `ScaleIT_Bridge_Windows_v1.0.0.zip` (or the supplied version) stored under the `OutputPath`.

If you prefer manual control, you can still run `Create-InstallerPackage.ps1` directly after you have `src-rust/target/release/scaleit-bridge.exe` and a populated `dist/` folder.

---

## 🏗️ Windows Toolchain Configuration

### MinGW/MSYS2 Setup (GNU Toolchain)
The project uses GNU toolchain instead of MSVC to avoid Visual Studio requirements:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "$mingwPath\bin;$mingwPath\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin;$env:PATH"
$env:CC = "$mingwPath\bin\gcc.exe"
$env:CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_LINKER = "$mingwPath\bin\gcc.exe"

_Note: If `cargo` still cannot find `ld`, ensure the path `D:\msys64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin` (where the GNU linker lives) appears before `$mingwPath\bin` in your `PATH`. This directory is also referenced by `build-rust-mingw.ps1`, `build-mingw.ps1` and test scripts so they can reuse the same linker._

# Rust toolchain
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

### Why GNU Toolchain?
- ❌ MSVC requires Visual Studio Build Tools (large install)
- ❌ cl.exe and C/C++ build tools missing in some environments  
- ✅ MinGW provides complete GNU toolchain (gcc, dlltool, ar, ranlib)
- ✅ Works without Visual Studio dependencies
- ✅ Smaller footprint and easier CI/CD integration

## 🔧 Architecture Details

### Rust Backend Architecture
```
DeviceManager
├── DeviceAdapterEnum (enum wrapper for object safety)
│   ├── RinstrumC320(RinstrumAdapter)
│   └── DiniArgeo(DiniArgeoAdapter)
├── Connection handling (TCP/Serial)
├── Command processing
└── Error handling & logging
```

### Adapter Pattern
- **DeviceAdapterEnum**: Solves `dyn DeviceAdapter` object safety issues
- **Concrete Adapters**: RinstrumAdapter, DiniArgeoAdapter
- **Connection Types**: TCP sockets, Serial ports
- **Command Mapping**: Device-specific protocol commands

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
```
✅ Server startup time: <2 seconds
✅ Response time: <50ms for health checks
✅ Memory usage: ~15MB base + dependencies
✅ Build time: ~2 minutes (first build)
✅ Scale connection: <1 second (TCP)
```

### Resource Usage
```
Backend (Rust):    ~25MB RAM, <1% CPU idle
Frontend (Vite):   Development server ~50MB RAM
Build artifacts:   ~15MB total size
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Fails with "dlltool not found"
```powershell
# Ensure MSYS2 MinGW-64 is installed and PATH is set
$env:PATH = "D:\msys64\mingw64\bin;D:\msys64\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin;$env:PATH"
```

#### Rust toolchain errors
```bash
# Reinstall GNU toolchain
rustup toolchain uninstall stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

#### Permission denied during build
```powershell
# Clean build artifacts
cargo clean
# Or delete target directory manually
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\src-rust\target
```

#### Scale device not connecting
- Check IP address and port in `config/devices.json`
- Verify network connectivity to scale device
- Ensure scale is powered on and responsive
